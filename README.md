# CaSkade | Capabilty- and Skill-based Automation

CaSkade is a novel framework for manufacturing engineering and control based on a semantic model of capabilities and skills. We provide software solutions that allow for an efficient engineering of manufacturing resources with semantically described functionalities. Building on these semantic models, we use AI to automatically plan and execute manufacutring processes.
